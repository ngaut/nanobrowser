  - [ ] Check browser console and extension background logs for errors.

## Notes & Takeaways
- Remember to export new functions/types from package entry points (e.g., `packages/storage/lib/index.ts`).
- Double-check UI elements after making significant code changes to ensure nothing is accidentally removed.
- Environment variables (`OLLAMA_ORIGINS`) are crucial for services like Ollama.
- Pay close attention to request payload structures when integrating with external APIs (e.g., Ollama `format` field).

## Project Activity Log

### Phase 1: Initial Project Analysis & Event System Enhancement
- **Status:** Completed
- **Summary:** Analyzed project structure, current event implementation (frontend: `pages/side-panel/src/types/event.ts`, `pages/side-panel/src/SidePanel.tsx`; backend: `packages/storage/lib/`), and planned enhancements.
- **Key Changes:**
    - Enhanced `EventData` model in `pages/side-panel/src/types/event.ts`.
    - Created `EventDetails.tsx` component for collapsible event details.
    - Updated `MessageList.tsx` to use `EventDetails.tsx`.

### Phase 2: Model Configuration Page - Connection Test Feature
- **Status:** Completed
- **Summary:** Added a "Test Connection" feature to the model settings page (`pages/options/src/components/ModelSettings.tsx`).
- **Key Changes:**
    - Created `packages/storage/lib/settings/connectionTest.ts` with provider-specific test functions.
    - Updated `ModelSettings.tsx` to include the test button, loading states, and result display.
    - Fixed build errors related to exports (`packages/storage/lib/index.ts`, `packages/storage/lib/settings/types.ts`).
    - Restored lost UI features in `ModelSettings.tsx` after initial "Test Connection" implementation.

### Phase 3: Debugging Ollama 403 Forbidden Error
- **Status:** Resolved
- **Issue:** User reported that despite a successful connection test for Ollama in the settings, actual tasks using Ollama failed with a "403 Forbidden" error.
- **Root Cause Analysis:**
    - The "Test Connection" feature only checked basic network connectivity to the Ollama server, not the full API integration.
    - For Chrome extensions to work with Ollama, the `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` environment variable must be set on the server.
- **Solution Implementation:**
    1. **Verified Ollama Installation:**
        - Confirmed Ollama was properly installed at `/opt/homebrew/bin/ollama`.
    2. **Configured Ollama with Proper Environment Variable:**
        - Stopped any running Ollama instances.
        - Set `OLLAMA_ORIGINS="chrome-extension://*"` to allow requests from any Chrome extension.
        - Restarted Ollama server with this configuration.
    3. **Verified Configuration in Logs:**
        - Confirmed from Ollama server logs that the ORIGINS setting included `chrome-extension://*`.
        - The log showed: `OLLAMA_ORIGINS:[chrome-extension://* http://localhost ...]`
    4. **Rebuilt and Tested the Extension:**
        - Ran a full build of the extension with `pnpm build`.
        - Tested the extension to confirm proper connectivity to Ollama.
- **Outcome:**
    - The extension can now properly connect to the Ollama server for both test connections and actual tasks.
    - The 403 Forbidden error is resolved.
- **Key Learnings:**
    1. Connection testing should simulate all aspects of the actual API calls, including CORS headers and origin checking.
    2. The `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` environment variable is critical for Chrome extension integration with Ollama.
    3. Different types of connection failures (network vs. permission) can present similar symptoms but require different solutions.

### Notes & Takeaways
- **Deeper Connection Testing:** Future enhancements to the connection test feature could make it more comprehensive by:
  - Testing with the same headers and origin information that actual API calls would use.
  - Providing more detailed diagnostics about why a connection might succeed or fail.
  - Testing more aspects of the API beyond basic connectivity.
- **Documentation:** Add clearer documentation about the need for `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` setting for Chrome extensions using Ollama.
- **UX Improvements:** Consider adding a diagnostic helper in the UI to check and suggest fixes for common configuration issues like missing environment variables.

### Debugging Tools & Strategies
- **Browser Developer Tools:** Console for frontend errors (especially CORS).
- **Ollama Server Logs:** For backend error messages and request rejection reasons.
- **`git diff` & `git log`:** Used to identify lost features and changes during development.
- **5 Whys Analysis:** Applied to systematically break down issues.

### Phase 4: Fixing Ollama JSON Format Errors
- **Status:** Resolved
- **Issue:** After resolving the connection issue, the Nanobrowser still failed with errors: `ResponseError: json: cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field ChatRequest.format of type string`.
- **Root Cause Analysis:**
    - Two main issues were identified:
        1. **Model Name Format Mismatch**: The model was named `bsahane/Qwen2.5-VL-7b` (with a hyphen) in the extension's request, but in Ollama it was actually registered as `bsahane/Qwen2.5-VL:7b` (with a colon).
        2. **JSON Structure Issue**: The Ollama API expected a string value for the `format` field, but the extension was likely sending an object structure instead.
- **Solution Implementation:**
    1. **Fixed Model References:**
        - Added the model with the correct name format (`bsahane/Qwen2.5-VL:7b`) to the list of default Ollama models in `packages/storage/lib/settings/types.ts`.
    2. **Fixed JSON Format Parameter:**
        - Modified the ChatOllama constructor arguments in `chrome-extension/src/background/agent/helper.ts` to explicitly include a `format: 'json'` parameter as a string.
    3. **Rebuilt and Tested the Extension:**
        - Ran a full build to incorporate the changes.
        - Tested with Ollama to verify the fix.
- **Outcome:**
    - The extension can now properly format requests to Ollama.
    - JSON parsing errors are resolved.
- **Key Learnings:**
    1. When working with LLM service APIs, it's important to match exactly the expected parameter formats and types.
    2. String vs. object type mismatches in JSON APIs can cause cryptic error messages that need careful debugging.
    3. Model naming conventions can differ between different contexts (UI references vs. actual API calls).

### Notes & Takeaways
- **API Format Validation:** Consider adding more robust validation of API request formats before sending them.
- **Error Handling:** Improve error messages to better indicate the specific formatting issues to aid in debugging.
- **Model Name Normalization:** Consider normalizing model names across the application to prevent format mismatches.
- **Testing Framework:** Add specific tests for API request formatting to catch these issues before they reach production.

### Phase 6: Documentation Enhancement - Ollama Setup Instructions
- **Status:** Completed
- **Issue:** Users needed clear instructions on how to configure Ollama to work with Chrome extensions like Nanobrowser.
- **Root Cause Analysis:**
    - The README lacked specific guidance on setting the required `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` environment variable.
    - Users encountering 403 Forbidden errors had no reference documentation to troubleshoot the issue.
    - The connection between version compatibility errors and upgrading Ollama was not clearly explained.
- **Solution Implementation:**
    1. **Added Comprehensive Ollama Setup Section:**
        - Created a new "Using Ollama with Nanobrowser" section in the README.
        - Provided step-by-step installation instructions for different operating systems.
        - Added ready-to-use scripts for macOS/Linux and Windows to properly configure Ollama.
    2. **Included Troubleshooting Guidance:**
        - Added specific troubleshooting steps for common issues like 403 Forbidden errors.
        - Provided clear instructions for resolving version compatibility issues.
        - Included model pulling commands for recommended models.
    3. **Explained Security Considerations:**
        - Clarified that the `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` setting is necessary for Chrome extension compatibility.
        - Explained that this setting doesn't compromise security as it only allows local extensions to access the local Ollama instance.
- **Outcome:**
    - Users now have clear, actionable instructions for setting up Ollama with Nanobrowser.
    - The provided scripts make it easy to consistently launch Ollama with the correct configuration.
    - Troubleshooting guidance helps users resolve common issues independently.
- **Key Learnings:**
    1. Documentation should include not just what to do, but why it's necessary (explaining the security model).
    2. Ready-to-use scripts significantly improve user experience for complex configuration tasks.
    3. Preemptively addressing common troubleshooting scenarios can reduce support burden and user frustration.
